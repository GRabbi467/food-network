        <p>
            <h3>I want to eat till I die</h3>
            I lost some weight once, but I found it again in the fridge. <br>

            I love pizza. I want to marry it, but it would just be to eat her family at the wedding. <br>
            
            I just want someone to look at me the way I look at food. <br>
            
            Sorry—I’m in a relationship. With food. <br>
            
             Sugar, spice, and everything nice. <br>
            
            My milkshake brings all the boys to the yard. <br>
            
             Home is wherever I’m with food. <br>
